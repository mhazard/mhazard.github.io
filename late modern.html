					18th century
				</h2>
				<p>
					By the end of 18th century in Continental Europe, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic, pushing the breasts upward.[89] The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Evening gowns and ball gowns were especially designed to display and emphasize the décolletage. Elaborate necklaces decorated the décolletage at parties and balls by 1849. There was also a trend of wearing camisole-like clothes and whale-bone corsets that gave the wearer a bust without a separation or any cleavage.[91] Despite the contemporaneous popularity of décolletage dresses, complete exposure of breasts in portraits was limited to two groups of women; the scandalous (mistresses and prostitutes), and the pure (breastfeeding mothers and queens). In North America, the Gilded Age saw women adorning their cleavage with flowers attached to clothes and carefully placed jewelry.

					19th Century
				</h2>
				<p>
					During the Victorian period of the mid-to-late 19th century, social attitudes required women to cover their bosoms in public. High collars were the norm for ordinary wear. Towards the end of this period, the full collar was in fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions. For that purpose, the Bertha neckline, which lay below the shoulders and was often trimmed with three to six inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of lace or other decorative material, became popular with upper and middle-class women but it was socially unacceptable for working-class women to expose that much skin. Multiple pearl necklaces were worn to cover the décolletage. Along with the Bertha neckline, straps were removed from corsets and shawls were made essential. In France, Belle Époque time photographs often featured Chinese fans to draw attention to the exposed cleavage.

					<em>Portrait of Madame X</em>, a 1884 painting by John Singer Sargent of American-born Parisian socialite Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, was heavily criticized for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and with her right shoulder strap having fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great Sargent reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder. Sargent left Paris for London in 1884. John Dudgeon, a Scottish missionary in China in the late 19th century, appreciated the Chinese non-décolleté fashion as a protection for the "abdomin and chest".

					By 1904, necklines of evening attire were lowered, exposing the shoulders, sometimes without straps but the neckline still ended above the cleavage. Clergymen all over the world were shocked when dresses with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the German Empire, Roman Catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.[104] In the Edwardian era, extreme uplift with no hint of cleavage was as common as a bow-fronted look that was also popular. In 1908, a single rubber pad or a "bust form" was worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.

					The word "cleavage" was first used in early 19th century in geology and mineralogy to mean the tendency of crystals, minerals and rocks to split along definite planes. By the mid-19th century, it was generally used to mean splitting along a line of division into two or more parts.

					1920s-1930s
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Flapper generation of 1920s flattened their chests to adopt the fashionable "boy-girl" look by either bandaging their breasts or by using bust flatteners.[109] Corsets started to go out of fashion by 1917, when metal was needed to make tanks and munitions for World War I[110] and due to the vogue for boyish figures.[111] In New Zealand, the early appearance of décolleté clothes in 1914 was soon superseded by the "flat" fashion.[112] Breast suppression prevailed in the Western world so much the U.S. physician Lillian Farrar attributed "virginal atrophic prolapsed breasts" to the fashion imperatives of the time.[113] In 1920, paraffin was replaced for breast augmentation with fatty tissue taken from the abdomen and buttocks.

					Frustrated with the whalebone corset, New York socialite Mary Phelps Jacob (better known as Caresse Crosby) created the first brassière from two handkerchiefs and some ribbon to show off her cleavage.[110][114][115][116] In 1914, Jacob patented the garment as "the backless brassiere"; after making a few hundred garments, she sold the patent to The Warner Brothers Corset Company for US$1,500. In the next 30 years, Warner Brothers made more than US$15 million from Jacob's design.[115][116] During the next century, the brassière industry went through many ups and downs, often influenced by the demand for cleavage.

					With a return to more womanly figures in the 1930s, corsetry maintained a strong demand, even at the height of the Great Depression.[111] From the 1920s to the 1940s, corset manufacturers constantly tried training young women to use corsets[118] but fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies during World War I and remained so for nearly half a century.[119] In the Republic of China in the early 20th century, qipao, a dress that shows the legs but no cleavage, became so popular many Chinese women consider it as their national dress.

					Male cleavage (also known as "heavage"), a result of low necklines or unbuttoned shirts, has been a movie trend since 1920s. Douglas Fairbanks revealed his chest in films including The Thief of Bagdad (1924) and The Iron Mask (1929), and Errol Flynn showed his male cleavage in movies like The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938).

					1940s
				</h2>
				<p>
					In the 1940s, a substantial amount of fabric in the center of brassières created a separation of breasts rather than a pushed-together cleavage.[128] In 1947, Frederick Mellinger of Frederick's of Hollywood created the first padded brassière followed a year later by an early push-up version dubbed "The Rising Star".[110][114] In that decade, Christian Dior introduced a "new look" that included elastic corsets, pads and shaping girdles to widen hips, cinch waists and lift breasts.

					Under the Motion Picture Production Code, which was in effect in the U.S. between 1934 and 1968, the depiction of excessive cleavage was not permitted.[130][131] Many female actors defied those standards; other celebrities, performers and models followed suit and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths were common.[132] In the post-war period, cleavage became a defining emblem; according to writer Peter Lewis; "The bust, bosom or cleavage was in the Fifties the apotheosis of erogenous zones. The breasts were the apples of all eyesyy."[133] Around this time, the American word "cleavage" started to be used to define the space between the breasts.

					In the 1940s, Joseph Breen, head of the U.S. Production Code Administration (PCA), applied the term to breasts in reference to actor Jane Russell's costumes and poses in the 1941 movie <em>The Outlaw</em>. The term was also applied in the evaluation of the British films <em>The Wicked Lady</em> (1945), starring Margaret Lockwood and Patricia Roc; <em>Bedelia</em> (1946), also starring Lockwood; and <em>Pink String and Sealing Wax</em> (1945), starring Googie Withers. This use of the term was first covered in a Time article titled <em>"Cleavage & the Code"</em> on August 5, 1946, as a "Johnston Office (the popular name for Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) office at the time[135]) trade term for the shadowed depression dividing an actress' bosom into two distinct sections."[107][130][136][131] The word "cleavage" is made of the root verb "cleave" (to split, from Old English clifian and Middle English clevien ("cleft" in past tense) and the suffix age (meaning "the state of" or "the act of").

					Development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s,[138] though it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of World War II freed metal for domestic use.[139][140] Aviator and filmmaker Howard Hughes' overemphasizing of Russel's cleavage prompted the MPAA to take actions against the film and use the term "cleavage" in association with breasts.[107][130][141] Hughes and Russell are considered pioneers of exaggerated cleavage in movies.[142] For the film Hughes designed a prototype for an underwire bra to give Russell "five and one-quarter inches" long cleavage.
				</p>

					Contrary to many media reports afterward, Russell did not wear the bra during filming; according to her 1988 autobiography, she said the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it.[143][144] She wrote that the "ridiculous" contraption hurt so much that she wore it for only a few minutes, and instead wore her own bra. To prevent Hughes from noticing, Russell padded the cups with tissue and tightened the shoulder straps before returning to the set. She later said "I never wore it in The Outlaw, and he never knew. He wasn’t going to take my clothes off to check if I had it on. I just told him I did."[145] The famed bra ended up in a Hollywood museum—a false witness to the push-up myth.

					Margaret Lockwood became one of the biggest star of British films in 1940s as audiences were scandalized by her decolletage that was quite mild by later standards.[147] In 1940s, a club called "Faye Emerson Plunging Neckline Club of Brooklyn" was founded as a tribute to American actress Faye Emerson.[148] Gina Lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960.[132] Hollywood actress Helen Talbot said that she was expected to wear falsies while shooting in 1940s.[149] At least one British film, <em>The Wicked Lady</em>, had to be partially reshot due to period costumes that were deemed overly revealing.[130][131] In 1953, Hollywood film <em>The French Line</em> was found objectionable under the Hays Code because of Jane Russell's "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her décolleté gowns were thought "intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage."
